# Mentor's Notes
This document shares guidelines on how mentors should approach this week's lesson.

Note that "Learning Goals" are not the same as "Student Goals".

**Learning Goals** - follow the CYF syllabus for that specific entire week

**Student Goals** - are primarily focus on the lesson during a Saturday session

## Student Goals

1. Students have declared their first variable
2. Students have assigned their first variable
3. Students understand that the equals sign "=", is not the same as the one in maths
4. Students can use a terminal, to run the command `node <file name>`



## Things to avoid teaching (for now)
Due to both time restraints and difficulty, it's worth teaching students concepts, that they can or will need to use straight away.

Else concepts will be learnt and not applied on straight away, which makes them easily forgettable.

### Course Material
**Incrementing and decrementing (Numbers)**
- It's worth highlighting that they exist
- However it's best to teach students about this alongside "loops"  - i.e. `for`, `while`, `do while` loops. The reason being is that this concept doesn't become useful for the students until later on. 

**Nested functions**
- Avoid teaching this topic for now, as it goes well with advanced concepts such as closures and callbacks

**Methods**
  - Practicing and using methods and highlighting that methods exist, is fine
  - However don't go deeper into what methods are and how they work should be left to later lessons Week 3.


**Quoients**
  - Don't - even though quoients accounts as an programming operator (i.e. "8 % 3 -> 2"). The concept of division & remainders, is likely to be difficult for students who have not gone into depth with a maths background
